# CS402
## HW1.java

#Design idea

1. This program will let user input “1” or “2” to choose to generate two rectangle integer matrices or double matrix. 
2. The size is predefined.  
3. After reading the user input, the program will automatically multiply these two random matrices in two ways(algorithms). 
4. Finally, the time spent by the two algorithms will be print out in nano second.

**Hint:** The program will print out both two matrix and the result matrix, in order to see all the output please make sure you remove the console output limitation, or you can common some print code.
